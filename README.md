# Mistigris: Spicy, Yet Balanced!

### MOD IS CURRENTLY IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT. EVERYTHING IS A PLACEHOLDER AND CONTENT IS NOWHERE NEAR COMPLETE! EXPECT THINGS TO BE BROKEN OR UNFINISHED!!

Welcome to Mistigris! Inspired by the likes of Paperback, Ortalab and Maximus, this is a vanilla-style mod intended to bring new, spicy gimmicks and playstyles to Balatro, while ensuring there is still a sense of order and balance!

This mod currently has:
* **28** new Jokers
* **1** new Boss Blind

with more to come in the future!
